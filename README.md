# PARKOUR - A Park Review App
![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
PARKOUR stands for "People Around Rambunctious Kids Openly Utilizing Recreation." It's an app designed to help parents and caregivers easily find and give reviews about parks and playgrounds.

Once the user creates and account, they have the ability to write, edit and delete their own reviews. They can also comment on other reviews. If the user doesnâ€™t want to make an account, they can still view park and playground reviews without the ability to comment or leave their own review.

View the deployed application at [https://parkour-review.herokuapp.com/](https://parkour-review.herokuapp.com/).

When the user signs up or logs in to their account, they are brought to their user dashboard which has a form that they can fill out to leave a review. It also lists the reviews that they have currently posted. When the user clicks the "Edit Review" button on one of their own reviews, they can edit the review, delete it or leave a comment.

![The screenshot on the left shows the user dashboard. A simple form with the fields "Park Name, Location, and Review" are listed for the user to fill out. The screenshot on the right shows an edit page for one of the user's posts.](/public/assets/screenshot-3.png)

While the user is logged in, they can go to the app's homepage to see recent reviews. When they click into an individual review, the user is able to comment on a review posted by another user.
